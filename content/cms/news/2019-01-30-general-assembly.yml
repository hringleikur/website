  At our annual general meeting this year we went over the projects and programs
  we started last year, as well as proposals for new directions in 2019. It has
  been a busy first year for Hringleikur. We had a successful tour of our
  classical show, continued the regular classes in the youth circus as well as
  added an additional weeknight training for the older students, and made
  significant progress on new projects.
